\title{Compute the centroid and the probability mass of the Vorono誰 cells}
\usage{
compute_centroids_and_proba(
  outputs,
  cell_numbers,
  method_IS = "unique",
  density_ratio = rep(1, dim(outputs)[length(dim(outputs))]),
  bias = rep(0, length(unique(unlist(cell_numbers))))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{outputs}{The output samples that need to be quantized. If method = "percell", a list of output samples must be provided, of length equal to the number of Vorono誰 cells.}

\item{cell_numbers}{The voronoi cell number of every output}

\item{method_IS}{The method of Importance Sampling : "unique" means there is a unique biased density involved, "percell" means there is one biased density (and then one biased sample) for each cell.}

\item{density_ratio}{A vector indicating the weight fX/g of each output. Default is a vector of 1. If method = "percell", a list of density_ratio must be provided, of length equal to the number of Vorono誰 cells.}

\item{bias}{A vector indicating the bias that came out when computing the importance sampling estimators of the membership probabilities. Each element of the vector is associated to a Voronoi cell. Default is 0 for all Voronoi cells.}
}
\value{
The centroid and the probability mass of each probability cell
}
